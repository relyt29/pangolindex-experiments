# Pangolin Experiments


This repo contains various calculators and tools for interacting with the Pangolin DEX at https://app.pangolin.exchange/


`avax_common.py` - mostly static variables, token addreses, etc

`crappy_arbitrage.py` - look for arbitrage opportunities in the exchange itself - further work could look at arb oppos accross centralized exchanges with pangolin, though probably someone else is already doing a better HFT job of that than you ever could

`pool_profitability.py` - Calculates whether you're making money being a liquidity provider for pangolin
